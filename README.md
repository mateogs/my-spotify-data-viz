# my-spotify-data-viz

This project includes three visualizations of my 2021 Spotify data, developed with the [D3.js library](https://d3js.org/).
The original activity data was provided by the [Spotify Web App](https://www.spotify.com/bo/) and later processed with *Python*, resulting in three different *json* files.
